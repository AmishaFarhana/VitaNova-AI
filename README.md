**Vita Nova: AI-Powered Waste Classification for Recovery Zones**
Vita Nova ("New Life") is an innovative web application designed to support waste management and resource recovery in war-affected regions. Using computer vision and AI technologies, Vita Nova helps field workers identify, classify, and safely handle various waste materials found in post-conflict zones.

**Project Description**
Vita Nova leverages machine learning to analyze images of waste materials and provide detailed classifications, safety information, and recycling recommendations. The application combines a Teachable Machine-trained model for visual recognition with the Perplexity AI API to deliver comprehensive material handling protocols tailored to recovery zone contexts.

**Key features include:**
Real-time waste material classification from uploaded images
Material-specific handling and safety recommendations
Detailed information on recycling potential and reuse opportunities
Custom prompts for specialized inquiries about different material types
User-friendly interface designed for field use in challenging environments
Focus on sustainability and resource recovery in post-conflict reconstruction

**Use Case**
In regions like Gaza and other war-affected areas, effective waste management is crucial for reconstruction efforts. Vita Nova helps field workers make informed decisions about material recovery, preventing environmental contamination while identifying valuable resources that can be repurposed for rebuilding. The system particularly focuses on safety, helping users identify potential hazards and handle materials appropriately.

**Technologies Used**
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), TensorFlow.js, Teachable Machine, Perplexity AI API, REST API integration, Font Awesome, Asynchronous programming, Computer vision, Environment configuration management.

**Project Status**
This application was developed as part of a hackathon focused on humanitarian technology solutions. It represents a functional prototype that demonstrates the potential of AI in supporting recovery zone waste management.
